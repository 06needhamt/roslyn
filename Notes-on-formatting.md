While working on formatting for recursive-patterns (PR [#26555](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/26555)), I've hit a number of issues. I'm capturing some notes of what I learnt from Heejae and others. That should provide some working knowledge of how to edit and troubleshoot rules, without having very deep knowledge of the formatting engine itself.

We'll start with an overview, then some scenarios, then some troubleshooting tips:

## Overview

The formatting is driven by multiple rules. The rules are chained in a certain order, and unless a decision was already made, the next rule gets to inspect each token pair (current token and previous token) and produce an operation. The engine collects all those operations of different kinds and applies them.

There are operations for spacing, for newlines (and newline suppressions), for indenting, for anchoring, and probably other ones.

## Scenarios

### Spacing

The default rule is to add spaces between every pair of tokens. Then there are rules to customize that (mostly in `TokenBasedFormattingRule.cs` and `SpacingFormattingRule.cs`). Some are driven by user-controlled options.

Ex: spacing in method declaration is affected by options.

`CreateAdjustSpacesOperation(0, AdjustSpacesOption.ForceSpaces)`
`CreateAdjustSpacesOperation(1, AdjustSpacesOption.ForceSpaces)`
`CreateAdjustSpacesOperation(0, AdjustSpacesOption.ForceSpacesIfOnSingleLine)`
`CreateAdjustSpacesOperation(1, AdjustSpacesOption.ForceSpacesIfOnSingleLine)`
`CreateAdjustSpacesOperation(space: 0, option: AdjustSpacesOption.PreserveSpaces)`

### Newlines

Example of typing `if () {}`.
Preserving lines (ie. requiring a minimum, but allowing user-input spaces), with minimum 0 or minimum 1

Suppressions

## Troubleshooting

My experience has been that it's not worth it to try and debug through the engine itself (it's very easy to get lost in the chain of rules), except for a few strategic locations. Also, conditional breakpoints are your friend, as you can choose to break only when the rule is considering a token of interest (for example, you can use `currentToken.ToString == "{"`).

Unittest vs. IDE (relates to the different things that can trigger formatting)
From what I've seen so far, issues that I found while manually testing in the IDE fell into typing categories:
- formatting (those are issues where you tweak some code, invoke formatting, and don't like the result). Those can be repro'ed in `FormattingTests.cs`.
- typing (braces and cursor placement). Those can be repro'ed in `AutomaticBraceCompletionTests.cs` (simulates typing `{` and getting a completion, then typing `enter` and getting a new formatted output as well as a cursor placement).


### TODO
some operations apply to spans
newlines and suppressions
indentation (and the relation to newlines)
gif for anchoring
Triggers for formatting (user can trigger, brace completion, end-of-line or other special characters?)
brace completion
note that in some scenarios, there isn't a need for formatting the whole document, so some operations that are deemed irrelevant will be discarded.
